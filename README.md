Data Cleaning 🫧 🧼
EDA ( Exploratory Data Analysis) 🧑
🏽‍💻
Two essential steps in the world of data analytics✨

🔹 Data Cleaning: 🧹
Before we dive into the wonders of EDA, let's not forget the crucial first step: data cleaning! 📝 It's like tidying up our messy room before we start searching for hidden treasures. Data cleaning involves identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, errors, and missing values in our datasets. By ensuring data quality, we pave the way for meaningful and accurate insights.

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 📊
Now, let's get to the heart of the matter – EDA! 🕵️‍♀️ This powerful technique enables us to unravel hidden patterns, trends, and relationships within our data. With EDA, we can visualize and summarize the main characteristics of our dataset, gain initial insights, and generate hypotheses for further analysis. It's like opening a treasure chest and discovering valuable gems of knowledge!

💼 Why are Data Cleaning and EDA vital? 💼
Data Cleaning: 🧹
✅ Ensures data accuracy and reliability
✅ Minimizes errors and bias in our analyses
✅ Builds a strong foundation for advanced analytics and machine learning models

EDA: 📊
